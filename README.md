## Install

### Package Control

The easiest way to install this is with [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/).

* If you just went and installed Package Control, you probably need to restart Sublime Text before doing this next bit.
* Bring up the Command Palette (Command+Shift+p on OS X, Control+Shift+p on Linux/Windows).
* Select "Package Control: Add Repository"
* Enter "https://github.com/clorax/sublime-twee2"
* Bring up the Command Palette again
* Select "Package Control: Install Package" (it'll take a few seconds)
* Select sublime-twee2 when the list appears (or type "twee2" and press enter)
* Package Control will automatically keep Twee up to date with the latest version.

### Git

If you need to find the Packages directory, access the Console (Control+`) and enter the following command:
