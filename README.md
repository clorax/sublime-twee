## Install

### Package Control

The easiest way to install this is with [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/).

* If you just went and installed Package Control, you probably need to restart Sublime Text before doing this next bit.
* Bring up the Command Palette (Command+Shift+p on OS X, Control+Shift+p on Linux/Windows).
* Select "Package Control: Install Package" (it'll take a few seconds)
* Select Twee when the list appears.
* Package Control will automatically keep Twee up to date with the latest version.

### Git

Clone this repository into the Packages directory.

If you need to find the Packages directory, access the Console (Control+`) and enter the following command:

    print sublime.packages_path()

### Manual

Drop the Twee.tmLanguage file into your Packages folder (Preferences > Browse Packages…).
